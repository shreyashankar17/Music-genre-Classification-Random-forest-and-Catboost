# Music-genre-Classification-Random-forest-and-Catboost
This project focuses on developing a robust music genre classification model using ensemble learning techniques, specifically Random Forest and CatBoost algorithms. The goal is to improve the accuracy of music genre classification, with a primary focus on the popular GTZAN Dataset. The project explores various machine learning models, feature engineering techniques, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal results.

Key Features:

Ensemble learning with Random Forest and CatBoost.
Handling of tabular data with categorical features.
Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Feature importance analysis for model interpretability.
